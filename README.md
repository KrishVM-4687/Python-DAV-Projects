# Python-DAV-Projects

This repository contains a series of Python projects focused on Data Analysis and Visualization (DAV). Each project is designed to solve a real-world business problem, covering a complete data analysis lifecycle from raw data to actionable insights.

The projects collectively demonstrate proficiency in the following key areas:

**Business Problem Solving:** Applying data analysis techniques to various business scenarios across different departments (e.g., Sales, HR, Finance).

**Data Wrangling with Pandas:**

**Data Integration:** Merging and combining multiple datasets for a holistic analysis.

**Data Transformation:** Combining or splitting columns to create new features.

**Data Cleaning:** Filling missing values in both numerical and string-based columns.

**Data Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn:**

**Comprehensive Charting:** Creating various plots to visualize different data relationships, including Categorical vs. Categorical, Categorical vs. Continuous, and Continuous vs. Continuous.

**Data Discretization:** Converting continuous data into discrete bins for effective visualization and analysis.

This repository serves as a practical portfolio of data skills, highlighting the ability to clean, transform, and visualize data to support data-driven decision-making.
